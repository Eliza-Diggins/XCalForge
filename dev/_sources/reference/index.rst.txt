ðŸ“š Core Workflows
===================

Master the core functionality of **XCalForge**, from generating synthetic spectral
libraries to applying statistical inference on observational datasets. At its core, **XCalForge** enables a
complete calibration workflow for X-ray astronomy, combining simulation,
machine learning, and statistical modeling:

Overview
--------

The core workflow in XCalForge involves simulating observations using different
telescope calibrations to construct a library of temperature discrepancies. These are
then used in an emulator to identify possible configuration changes to re-callibrate
telescopes.
