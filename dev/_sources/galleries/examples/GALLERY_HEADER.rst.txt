XCalForge Example Gallery
==========================

Welcome to the **XCalForge Example Gallery** â€” your hands-on introduction to the tools, workflows, and capabilities powering X-ray calibration research with XCalForge.

This gallery presents a curated collection of short, practical examples demonstrating how to:

- Generate synthetic X-ray spectra using realistic or perturbed calibration files,
- Build modification libraries for systematic bias studies,
- Quantify temperature recovery performance under various calibration scenarios,
- Interface with XSPEC, ARF/RMF manipulation tools, and XCalForge's parallelized simulation framework.

---

Dive in to explore core concepts like:

- Modifying effective area curves (ARFs) with controlled perturbations,
- Generating synthetic observations with calibration distortions,
- Automating large-scale parameter studies with MPI,
- Analyzing bias trends in astrophysical parameter recovery,

Use these examples as quick-start guides or as building blocks for your own calibration validation projects.
